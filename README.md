# Everything-Wrapper
Better UI for Everything search over web.

Initial rough draft of the application. 

## How to run:
1. Run `node index` as a proxy server to get around the issue of CORS.
2. Change the hard-coded URL and port in `index.js` and `search.js`
2. Landing url is: `IP_ADDRESS:PORT/index.html`.

## Upcoming features:
* Add search filters into the UI.
* Different views - list view, details view, large/medium/small view.
* Replace table with cards.
* Overhaul the UI into a modern responsive design.

## Todo:
* Port the website to react framework for a streamlined SAP.
* Integrate the app into the default Everything server.
